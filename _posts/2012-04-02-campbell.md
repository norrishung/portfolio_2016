As the technical lead on this project, I was responsible for defining and maintainable a scalable HTML/CSS framework for the entire series. I worked closely with the design lead to translate design mocks into responsive web layouts and stress-test them to make sure we both understood how the designs would respond across devices and text flow/image size edge cases. I was also resposible for building out a style guide in which our production team in India would use to build every page of the book and lead communciation with them when problems arose.
