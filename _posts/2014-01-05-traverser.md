At Inkling I built web tools in my spare time to solve problems. Working on dozens of book over the first year, I began to wonder whether I could do anything to make the process easier for other team members. What started off as hacking projects ended up becoming incredibly useful tools still used in the company today.

At Inkling, I built various tools to help content editors do their jobs more easily. Traverser was a tool that helped editors proof links in digital books. Users could quickly navigate between links using keyboard shortcuts. This turned days worth of work to hours.
