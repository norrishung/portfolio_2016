My name is Norris and design is how I choose to <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1960/first-things-first/">make the world a better place</a>. I strive to elegantly shape materials into products and services that better fit the human condition. I do this by developing a deep understanding of people through research and developing a deep appreciation of materials through practice.

I am known to obsess over typefaces, chairs, and cookies. My favorite typeface is [Harriet](https://okaytype.com/typefaces/harriet) by OkayType. My favorite chair is the [Wishbone Chair](https://www.carlhansen.com/en/collection/chairs/ch24/wishbone-chair-black-natur/variant/701) by Hans Wegner. My favorite cookie is the Chocolate Cherry Almond Cookie at [Bovine Bakery](http://www.bovinebakeryptreyes.com).

As a Bay Area native, I prefer to spend my time in nature through backpacking and climbing. In 2014, I walked 2667 miles on the <a href="https://twitter.com/findmynorris">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. In 2016, I backpacked 195 (mainly off-trail) miles on the [Sierra High Route](https://andrewskurka.com/adventures/sierra-high-route/).
