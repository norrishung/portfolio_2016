My name is Norris and design is how I choose to <a href="http://firstthingsfirst2014.org/">make the world a better place</a>. I strive to make better products and content through simplifying and humanizing. I have a special enthuasiasm for design thinking, typography, information design, and web development.

Outside of design, I spend a lot of time thinking about conscious capitalism, sustainable food and agriculture, and journalism.

In my spare time, I prefer to spend my time in nature through backpacking, cycling, and climbing. So much so that, in 2014, I decided to hike from Mexico to Canada on the <a href="https://twitter.com/findmynorris">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. I also love cooking with friends and fermenting everything I can get my hands on. I am eternally on a quest to find the best chocolate chip cookie in the Bay Area.

Take a look at my <a href="http://www.norrishung.com/img/norrishung_resume.pdf">resume</a> or <a href="https://dribbble.com/norrishung">dribbble</a> account.
